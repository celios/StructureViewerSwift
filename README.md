# StructureViewerSwift
At this point, all the steps from [this guide](http://forums.structure.io/t/guide-to-setting-up-a-swift-project/4020) have been completed except for step 3, actually adding the Structure.framework.

You can request access to the SDK at [http://developer.structure.io/sdk](http://developer.structure.io/sdk)

Then just follow the instructions from Step 3.
